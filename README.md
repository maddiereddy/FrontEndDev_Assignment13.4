### Assignment 13.4 of the AcadGild Front End Web Dev Course

Create a component and show a list of User.  
Then create a link based row and navigate with userId to new page and  
show the detail of that user based on that userId.

Notes:
* Run `npm run serve` to start app
* Used Hash style URL (because typing in the path directly was not working and  
 when I refreshed the browser it redirected me to 404 page.)
